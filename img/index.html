    Growing up I honestly never liked cooking. It wasn't until I started living on my
    own that I became fond of it. I grew up eating mexican dishes only-which were great,
    im not complaining BUT of course I wanted to try different foods but never had the want
    to go in the kitchen and do it myself. I guess its something about having my own space,
    no one around to bother me that makes me love being in the zone, following recipes and adding
    my own twist to them. I was scared I would be surviving off of simple meals but im happy I learned
    how to cook a variety of dishes. Some of my favorite recipes are

    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K5P0zeoS1w'</a>Creamy Salmon lasanga roll ups </a>
